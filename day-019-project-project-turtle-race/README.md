# Day 19 Project: Turtle Race

## Concept

This program uses the [turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to run a racing game with
6 colored turtles. The user is prompted to enter a color between `"black", "orange", "blue", "red", "green", and
"purple"` as a bet, then the race begins. The turtles move forward in the screen at a random pace between 0 and
10 paces until the right-end of the screen. Whenever the first turtle reaches the end, the race stops and
the console prints whether the user's bet was right along with the color of the winning turtle.
