# Day 75 Project: Google Trends and Data Visualization

## Concept

This project combines Google Trends with other Time Series Data (sources are found in the notebook). A summary
of the main questions this analysis tries to perform is related to these three main topics:

- How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin;
- How search volume for a hot stock (Tesla) relates to that stock's price;
- How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States.

The steps for this analysis were data exploration, data cleaning, and finally, data visualisation with
proper plotting of formatted charts.
