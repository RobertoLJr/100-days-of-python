# Day 27 Miles to Km Converter

## Concept

This program is an introduction to the tkinter package and the usage of GUI with Python. It is by no means a
complex implementation, but allows for buildup. This program uses the tkinter package to build a GUI capable of
converting values from Miles to Kilometers. Upon executing the program, the user should provide a float value
into the entry box and click on the `Calculate` button to see the result.

Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the Python's _de facto_ standard GUI.
