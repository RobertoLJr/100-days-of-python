# Day 21 Project: Snake Game

## Concept

The [Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) is one of the most popular mobile games
where the players maneuver the end of a growing line, typically themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake
from colliding with both the walls and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.

This program works using the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) module from Python. The user controls the snake using
the arrow keys of the keyboard to get to a piece of food represented by a red dot that appears randomly on
the screen. The user should avoid collision with the snake's own body and with the edges of the screen. A
score is shown above. Whenever a collision happens, the game ends.
