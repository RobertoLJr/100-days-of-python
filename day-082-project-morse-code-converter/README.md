# Morse Code Converter

[Visualise the implementation in its own repository](https://github.com/RobertoLJr/morse-code-converter).

## Concept

This program functions as a simple text-based [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) Converter
that goes both ways, allowing the user to transform a _string_ into Morse Code or to decode a Morse Code into plain
text.

It uses four of the five representational elements for the International Morse code, as follows:

1. short mark, dot or dit (.): "dit duration" is one time unit long;
2. long mark, dash or dah (-): three time units long;
3. ~~inter-element gap between the _dits_ and _dahs_ within a character: one dot duration or one unit long;~~
4. short gap (between letters): three time units long;
5. medium gap (between words): seven time units long (formerly five[6]).

## Usage

1. Run the program and select one of the three operations in the terminal (1. Encode | 2. Decode | 3. Exit);
2. Enter the text to be encoded/decoded;
3. Visualize in the terminal the result of the operation.
