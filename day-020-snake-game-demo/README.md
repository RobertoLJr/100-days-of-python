# Day 20 Project: Snake Game (demo)

## Concept

The [Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) is one of the most popular mobile games
where the players maneuver the end of a growing line, typically themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake
from colliding with both the walls and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.

This program works using the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) module from Python
only to establish the first setup of the Snake Game. The full implementation will be developed and deployed in
the Day 21 Project, since the goal of this project is to work on free experimentation of the turtle module.
