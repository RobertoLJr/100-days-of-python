# Day 55 Project: Higher or Lower Web Game

## Concept

Introducing the concept of backend for web development, this program uses Flask to create a web-based game that asks you to guess a number between zero and nine. It uses a
randomly picked number from this range as the correct answer, producing a new one every time the program is executed.
The input should be provided as an extension to the URL (`URL/3` or `URL/9`), which opens a new page informing the
user if their answer is too low, too high or if they found the number.
