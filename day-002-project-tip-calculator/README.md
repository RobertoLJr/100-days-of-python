# Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator

## Concept

The Tip Calculator greets the user and asks for a numeric value representing a total bill. Then, it asks
for how many people to split the bill and waits for another numeric value input. The program also asks
for what percentage tip the user would like to give, providing choices and taking yet another numeric
value as input.

Finally, the program calculates how much each person should pay taking into account all the information
given.
