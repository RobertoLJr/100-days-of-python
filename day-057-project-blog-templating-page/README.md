# Day 57 Project: Blog Templating Page

## Concept

This program uses Flask and Jinja to simulate a blog to present posts coming from a fake API call. Each post in the
home page shows only a title and a subtitle, followed by a `Read` link that uses URL building and routing to redirect
the user to the post's page, containing the entire body for complete reading.
