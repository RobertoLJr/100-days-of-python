# Day 16 Project: Coffee Machine (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Concept

This program is a very common simulation of a simple coffee machine. It works very similarly to the coffee machine
program from the [Day 15 Project: Coffee Machine](../day-015-project-coffee-machine). However, this implementation was developed
under the [Object-Oriented Programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), abstracting
inner implementations within classes and objects, thus  providing a more concise main program and a more complex
structure in favour of modularization.
