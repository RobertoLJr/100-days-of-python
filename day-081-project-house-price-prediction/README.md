# Day 81 Project: House Price Prediction

## Concept

Today's project builds a model to predict a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
the number of rooms, the distance to employment centres, how rich/poor the area is, and how
many students there are per teacher in local schools. The `boston.csv` data relates to information
from Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s. The source of the original paper can be found inside the
notebook.
