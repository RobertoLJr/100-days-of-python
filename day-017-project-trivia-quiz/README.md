# Day 17 Project: Trivia-Quiz

## Concept

This program works as a simulation of a simple trivia-quiz game in which the answer for each question could
either be True or False. The program also keeps track of the user's score. It asks for a user input and
checks said input against the question's correct answer, immediately presenting the user with their current
score and the next question, if there are any remaining.
