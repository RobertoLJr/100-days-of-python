# Day 76 Project: Plotly Charts and Android App Store Analysis

## Concept

In this project, some comparisons were made using the Pandas functionalities along with
visualisation in Plotly charts. The source for the data can be found inside the notebook.
The analysis could be summarised into the following topics:

- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are;
- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity;
- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free;
- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app;
- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue;
How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue.
