# Day 6 Project: Escaping the Mazer

## Concept

### Disclaimer

This program will not work outside the environment provided by the link in the Resources section as
it contains built-in functions from Reeborg's World website.

---

This program was actually written to run on _Reeborg's World Maze Challenge_ provided by the link in the
Resources section below.

The program uses loops, control flow structures and functions to make sure the robot keeps moving
methodically until it finds the exit of the maze. As it is written, the robot will follow along the
right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it can't turn right, and
turning left as a last resort.
