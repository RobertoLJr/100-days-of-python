# Day 54 Studies: Introduction to Web Development with Flask, CLI, and Python Decorators

This directory does not contain a project like the previous ones per se. Instead, it compiles some references in
links and files for further study and quick review.

The code in `hello.py` is an example of the Flask quick implementation.

The code in `decorators.py` contains a quick exercise for the implementation of Python function decorators. The goal is
to use a simple decorator to execute different functions and print their execution times in the console.
