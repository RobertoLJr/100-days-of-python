# Day 64 Project: Top 10 Movies Website

## Concept

This program functions as a web application for viewing, updating, and deleting movies in a ranking order. In fact,
it allows for more than 10 movies to be added, and it works by creating a database connection via SQLAlchemy. Data
is requested from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en), therefore a free account with an API Token set up
are required as environment variable.
