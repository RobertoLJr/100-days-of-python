# Day 3 Project: Dragon Adventure

## Concept

This text-based minigame applies control flow concepts to guide the user through a short adventure
in the Sword Coast, a location from Dungeons & Dragons.

The program greets the user and presents some context with two options. It then waits for user's
input and proceeds with a Game Over or another context, depending on that choice.

The user's goal should be to reach the end of the program and Win the adventure.
