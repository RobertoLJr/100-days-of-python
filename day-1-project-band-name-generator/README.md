# Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator

## Concept

The Band Name Generator takes the name of the city you grew up in (or any other) as an input and stores
that value into a variable. It does the same thing for your pet's name (or any other).

Afterward, the program outputs a String, concatenating those variables to make up a name for a band.
