# Day 78 Project: Linear Regression and Data Visualisation with Seaborn

## Concept

This project works with a movie budget and revenue data. It uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to
also run a linear regression and seaborn to visualise the data. Some questions that this project
might answer are as follows:

- Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office?
- What were the movies with the lowest and highest budgets? And revenues?
- What does a linear regression look like when comparing movie budgets and revenues?
- Is it possible to build a model to predict the revenue of an x-budgeted film?
