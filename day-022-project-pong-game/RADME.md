# Day 22 Project: Pong Game

## Concept

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics,
and it is one of the earliest arcade video games. This implementation works for **two players** and the
goal for each player is to make the ball bounces on their respective paddle before the ball crosses their
respective wall, in which case the opponent scores a point.

- The **right paddle** is controlled by the **W** and **S** keys of the keyboard.
- The **left paddle** is controlled by the **Up** and **Down** Arrow keys of the keyboard.
- The ball increases its speed slightly whenever it bounces on either paddle.
