This project works based on the [Day 21 Project: Snake Game](../day-021-project-snake-game). However, it brings an
adjustable screen size that draws clearer walls for any screen size. Also, the game saves the user's highest
score from any previous gameplay in a local file and always show that score whenever a new game is executed.
