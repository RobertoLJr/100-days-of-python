# Day 59 Project: Bootstrap Blog

## Concept

This program simulates a blog page with interactive posts that lead to individual pages, each containing title, subtitle, body, author, date, and a personal background image. It makes use of Flask, Bootstrap and Jinja capabilities. The data provided as content comes from [n:point](https://www.npoint.io/) to simulate an API call (the JSON structure that works for the current implementation is provided in the data directory).
