# Day 61 Project: Advanced Forms with Flask WTForms

## Concept

This program runs webpages with Flask, Jinja and Bootstrap to load a login form with Flask WTForms validation and rendering capabilities. It
uses built-in validations for email and password inputs, and loads two different pages: one for the right credentials
and another for the wrong ones. The right credentials are in the `main.py` file and are `admin@email.com` for the
email and `12345678` for the password.

Be sure to read the comments on the `main.py` file for installation of requirements.
