# Day 25 Project: U.S. States Game

## Concept

This program uses the Pandas library and the turtle module to create a guessing game. The user should
try to complete the map with all states of the United States of America by entering a state's name in the prompt.

Whenever the user inputs a correct state, its name appears on the underlying map; otherwise, nothing changes.
The user is once again prompted for another state. Once the user completes all the states, the game ends.

By typing `Exit` in the prompt, the program ends prematurely and a `states_to_learn.csv` CSV file is
generated, containing all the states not guessed by the user on the occasion of exiting the program.

The input is case-insensitive.
