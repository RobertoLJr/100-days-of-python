# Day 73 Project: Data Visualisation with Matplot Lib

## Concept

This program does not include a `main.py` file. Instead, for Data Science projects, a notebook works fine. The
`Programming_Languages.ipynb` file contains a few annotations and works with the `QueryResults.csv` from the
data directory. This data comes from Stack Overflow and refers to the number of posts relating to many programming languages
along the years. In the notebook, there is instruction to how to perform said query and get results that are more up to date.
