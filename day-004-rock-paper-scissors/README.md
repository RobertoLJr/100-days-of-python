# Day 4 Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Concept

Rock Paper Scissors is a globally cherished zero-sum game played by two people using their hands
and no tools. Players make hand shapes, each with a certain degree of power, ultimately leading
to an outcome.

This program simulates that game and stats by first prompting the user for a numeric input according
to the instructions - 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors. It then compares the result with
the choice made **randomly** by the computer using the same list, printing both choices and declaring
the winner according to the [rules](https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/).
