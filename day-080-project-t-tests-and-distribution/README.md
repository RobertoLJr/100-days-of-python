# Day 80 Project: T-Tests and Distribution

## Concept

This project analyzes data coming from an interesting story in the medical field. Those are contained
in the files `annual_deaths_by_clinic.csv` and `monthly_deaths.csv` from the data directory.

In Vienna, during the 1800s, a medical doctor called Ignaz Semmelweis observed that many women
in the Vienna General Hospital died from puerperal fever, especially when autopsies were performed
right before childbirth by the same people doing the procedure.

At that time, illnesses were suspected to be caused by miasmas or evil spirits rather than pathological
entities such as bacteria and viruses. After some analysis and research, Dr. Semmelweis proposed
handwashing with a disinfectant substance, causing the death rates to significantly reduce. The
details of this story can be found in the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis)
article about the man himself.

Some questions that guided this analysis with charts were:

- What was the percentage of women giving birth who died throughout the 1840s at the hospital?
- Which of the two clinics performed more work related to giving birth, judging by its numbers?
- What was the highest number of deaths recorded in both clinics?
- What was the average percentage of monthly deaths before handwashing (circa 1847)?
- What was the average percentage of monthly deaths after handwashing was made obligatory?
- And more (see the notebook)
