# Day 77 Project: Computation with NumPy and N-dimensional Arrays

## Concept

This project works with NumPy mainly to check its functionalities in maths and
image manipulation. Core topics covered are creation of ndarrays, access to
individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array, how broadcasting
works with ndarrays, linear algebra with NumPy, and how to generate points available
for plotting on a chart.
