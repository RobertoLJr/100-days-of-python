# Day 18 Project: Hirst Painting

## Concept

This program is works with the [turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to
create a piece of digital art inspired by the works of contemporary artist
[Damien Hirst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst), more specifically his dot-covered
pieces.

The [colorgram library](https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/) is used to extract a color
palette from any given image referred in the code. With the use of the turtle module, the
screen works as a canvas for a brush to paint any given number of random-colored dots in
a row, repeating the process in a row above for any given times.
