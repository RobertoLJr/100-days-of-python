# Day 45 Project: The 100 Best Movies Of All Time List by Empire

## Concept

This program makes use of Web Scrapping with the Python module Beautiful Soup (see resources) to get hold of all the
100 movies from the [Empire's The 100 Best Movies Of All Time list](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/)
and write them into a .txt file. Since the list starts from 100 to 1, the program also reverts the list to start
writing the movie titles from the 1 to the 100.
