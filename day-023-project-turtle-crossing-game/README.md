# Day 23 Project: Turtle Crossing Game

## Concept

In this game, the player controls a turtle that should try to cross a busy street with running colorful cars.
First, the player should declare the game difficulty between **easy** and **hard**, and then try to get to
the other side of the road without colliding with any car.

- The **easy** difficulty allows for the turtle to move **up, down, left and right**.
- The **hard** difficulty allows for the turtle to move only upwards.

Each time the turtle reaches the other side of the road, the speed of all the cars is increased by a fixed
amount. Once a collision happens, the game ends.
