# Day 50 Project: Automated YouTube Filter

## Concept

This program uses web scraping with Selenium to automatically open up a Chrome browser and search for videos using
the query "synthwave" while filtering for the last week uploads. Then, it opens the first video at the top of the
page. The user can end the program by pressing any key into the console, as prompted by the program itself. Potentially,
this program can be tweaked for other filters and data can be collected, features that could be implemented in the future.

Potentially, this program finds the most relevant video of the week for the query!

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter any key into the console when you want the web browser to close and end the program.
